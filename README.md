 I left this in react even though I just used normal js because I was lazy.

Here is a <a href="https://pokedex.kachow.me">link</a> to it.

Also it takes a long time to load because I didn't put a "load more" button.

Based on code from <a href="https://medium.com/@sergio13prez/fetching-them-all-poke-api-62ca580981a2">here</a> and <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_js_filter_lists.asp">here</a>.
